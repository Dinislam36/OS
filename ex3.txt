output of 1st program:
Hello
Hello

output of 2nd program:
Hello


----------------------
This is happens, bacause putput stream t terminal are line buffered.
But after fork, state is full buffered.
When data goes to terminal output stream, it line buffered and then,
only last buffered line (the last one in full buffer) will be printed
In 1st program, buffered line is Hello, when in 2nd is "\n".
Thats why programs returns such different outputs.
